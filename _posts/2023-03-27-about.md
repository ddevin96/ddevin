<!-- ## About me   -->

I am a PhD student at the University of Salerno, Italy. I am a member of the [ISISLab](https://isislab.unisa.it/) research group, led by [Professor Vittorio Scarano](https://docenti.unisa.it/001717/home). 
Here, I have the opportunity to collaborate with [Professor Gennaro Cordasco](https://sites.google.com/site/cordasco/) and with [Carmine Spagnuolo](https://spagnuolocarmine.github.io/). 
I am the creator and one of the mantainer of [krABMaga](https://krabmaga.github.io/) project.
In my spare time, I love to listen to music and to play video games. 
I really enjoy take part in social activities and I am a member of ARCI(Associazione ricreativa culturale italiana) since 2017!
