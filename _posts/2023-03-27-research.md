<!-- ## Research   -->

- As a researcher, my passion lies at the crossroads of complex networks, agent-based modeling and social phenomena. I find it truly
fascinating to understand how social interactions unfold and transform at both the micro and macro level while exploring the impact of 
complex network structures on the dynamics of the system. 
- Since the beginning of my Ph.D., I am specifically working with hypergraph to unravel the dynamics of social phenomena.
- I am interested in developing:
  - Hypergraph specific algorithms to model and simulate social phenomena
  - Social patterns and user behavior in online social networks
  - Exploit cutting-edge technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence to analyze and predict social phenomena
- I am also interested in other fields such as:
  - Agent-based modelling
  - Distributed computing
  - Cloud-based technologies
  
- If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me!
